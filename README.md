# What does it do?

This script reads image files provided as an argument. Then calculates
the vertical average for the red, green, and blue values and writes the
average and sum of the 3 averages to a CSV file.

# Why does it sum up the RGB values?

This script is about finding absorption lines in spectra. Each color
value is a signal and we want the best signal-to-noise ratio.
